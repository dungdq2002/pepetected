Imagine a world where your confidential messages are hidden within the hilarious world of Pepes. Welcome to Pepetected, the app that turns your everyday conversations into a comedy show and a cryptic puzzle all in one!

With Pepetected, you can take your secret messages and wrap them up in a meme so funny that even if someone stumbles upon your chat, they'll be too busy laughing to decode your hidden gems. It's like having your own personal inside joke that's also a covert operation.

## Demo
Do you think these 2 images are the same?

In fact, the right one is embedding "Welcome to pepetected!" but it is only revealed if you **enter the correct password**!

We also provide a simpler version, in case you only want to hide by text only.
